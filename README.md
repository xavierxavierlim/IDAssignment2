# Covid Website
The website that we have created is a Covid website that aims to educate users on the Covid-19 pandemic so that they know how to protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus. Additionally, there is also a shop where they can buy items such as hand sanitiser and masks to further protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus. If they are planning to travel, they can check the number of Covid-19 cases in the country that they are planning to travel to.

# Design Process
- As a user who plans to travel overseas or travels overseas frequently, I would like a website where I can conveniently check the number of Covid-19 cases for the country that I am travelling to so that I know how good or bad the Covid situation is in that country. This will allow me to better prepare myself to protect myself from the virus.

- As a user who wants to check for the number of Covid-19 cases and plan my itinerary at the same time, I would like a website with a built-in map as well so that I can plan my itinerary to the country by finding out important information like how long it takes to travel from one place to another and what are the routes to get from one place to another.

- As a user who wants to learn more about Covid-19 and how to protect myself from the virus, I would like a website where I can enjoy learning about Covid-19 such as through quizzes instead of reading off huge chunks of information from websites or watching Youtube videos as it can get quite dry and boring. It would also be better if I earn points or something similar which can be used for something useful so that it motivates me to learn the information properly to answer more questions correctly. 

- As a user who wants to buy items to protect myself and my loved ones from Covid-19 such as masks and hand sanitiser, I would like a website where I can buy authentic hygiene items which are tested and proven to protect myself and my loved ones from the virus.

- As a user who just wants to enjoy using the website, I would like a mini game where I can play with my friends or family members just to pass time and have some fun.

# Features
- On every page, there is a navbar which contains 6 buttons: Shop, Quiz, Game, Socials, developers or Home (icon) to allow users to easily navigate through pages without having trouble to find any page in the website. These buttons are located at the top of every webpage so that users do not have to scroll back and forth to navigate through the website and so that they can go onto any page from the current page they are looking at. Additionally, all pages also have a log out button so that users can log out from any page instead of having to go to one page before they can log out so the log out button on every page makes it easier and more convenient for users to log out.

- On the login / signup page home, apart from the introductory content that they first see when they first click into the website, they can see the covid cases over time starting from 2019 to present (2023). This allows them to see how the rate that Covid-19 is growing, so that they can take the necessary precautions if they are planning to travel overseas. Although this page does not show the covid cases for the individual countries, it is a good indicator as to how good or bad the world is fighting against Covid-19 which allows them to better prepare themselves against the Covid-19 virus. The services that we provide, which is the shop, quiz, game and map shows users the features that we offer if they log in or sign up as if they try to click any of those words, an alert will appear telling them that they have to log in or sing up first. If users scroll down a bit more, they will be able to see the shop preview, which contains 3 items from the shop that is on discount now. This is to give users a glimpse of the things we sell and to entice them by showing the discounted items at the front page. THe footer and office locations provides additional information regarding our website and if they want to contact us, they can do so by either emailing us or calling 1 of the 4 numbers if they are in any of the 4 countries stated.

- After users login, they will be directed to a page where a welcome message is stated. (Welcome [name that you used when you signed up]). This is to make it more friendly to users as their name is personalised for them on the website. Below that welcome message, there is a navigational map which users can use to plan their itenary if they are travelling overseas and below it shows 16 countries(that Singaporeans go the most) arranged in alphabetical order so that it is user for them to find the country they are looking for which they can click on and they will be brought to the World Health Organisation about the Covid-19 situation in the country they selected. Since one of the purposes of the website is to let users check the number of Covid-19 cases, this website can make it more convenient for them by letting them plan their itenary with our map at the same time instead of having to use a different application or tab to check the map. For example, if I want to go to Japan, after checking the number of Covid-19 cases on the website, I can also plan my iternary with the map (i.e. check how long it takes from one place to another, check the route I have to take to get from one place to another) given on the website so this saves me time as I do not have to constanly switch between applications or tabs to check the Covid-19 cases and access the map since I can do both with the same website at the same time.

- The shop page contains all the items that we are selling. The discounted items are put in the top row and the non-discounted items will be placed below the discounted ones so that users take note of the discounted items first before seeing everything else that we are selling.

- The quiz page contains videos that users can watch to learn about the Covid-19 virus and how to protect themselves and their loves ones from the virus. There will also be a quiz where they can attempt and the more questions they get correct, the more points they will get and the points can be used to get a discount in the shop. For example, 1 point is equal to 1 cent so if they have 50 points, they can get a 50-cent discount on any item in the shop. This discount applies to discounted items as well. This way, not only do they get to learn about the Covid-19 virus, they are also more likely to buy items from the shop as the points they earned from the quiz can be used to get a discount in the shop.

- The game page contains a simple tic-tac-toe game that users can invite their friends and family members to play with them. This does not have point implementation, as it is just a simple game for users to stay on the website longer as the longer they stay on the website, the more engaged they will be and there will be higher chance that they check out other features of our website and they can be customers for our shop. If they are feeling bored, they can hop onto the website to play this simple tic-tac-toe game with their friends or family members just to have some fun.

# Technologies Used
- HTML is used for define the structure of the website.
- CSS is used to style the website (i.e., add colours, padding, etc.)
- Javascript will be used for the API implementation and to add interactivity to the website. As of now, there are only javascript featuers to the map and the login page.
- JQuery will be used for Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation
- Bootstrap is used for the navbar.
- RestDB will be used to store user data when they login or sign up and also the points users earn from the quiz.

# Testing
Up to date, most of the features have not been implemented yet. The quiz page has not been implemented yet and the map which is supposed to be clicked on to display the number of Covid-19 cases for the area clicked on is only halfway done. The buttons on the navbar to direct users to the respective pages are working. However, other features such as the applying discount to items through usage points, API to store user data and points and form validation have yet to be implemented as of now.
