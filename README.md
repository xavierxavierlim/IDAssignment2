# Covid Website
The website that we have created is a Covid website that aims to educate users on the Covid-19 pandemic so that they know how to protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus. Additionally, there is also a shop where they can buy items such as hand sanitiser and masks to further protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus. If they are planning to travel, they can check the number of Covid-19 cases in the country that they are planning to travel to.

# Design Process
- As a user who plans to travel overseas or travels overseas frequently, I would like a website where I can conveniently check the number of Covid-19 cases for the country that I am travelling to so that I know how good or bad the Covid situation is in that country. This will allow me to better prepare myself to protect myself from the virus.

- As a user who wants to learn more about Covid-19 and how to protect myself from the virus, I would like a website where I can enjoy learning about Covid-19 such as through quizzes instead of reading off huge chunks of information from websites or watching Youtube videos as it can get quite dry and boring. It would also be better if I earn points or something similar which can be used for something useful so that it motivates me to learn the information properly to answer more questions correctly. 

- As a user who wants to buy items to protect myself and my loved ones from Covid-19 such as masks and hand sanitiser, I would like a website where I can buy authentic hygiene items which are tested and proven to protect myself and my loved ones from the virus.

# Features
- On every page, there is a navbar which contains 4 buttons: shop, home, developers, socials or learn (depending on which page the user is looking at) to allow users to easily navigate through pages without having trouble to find any page in the website. These buttons are located at the top of every webpage so that users do not have to scroll back and forth to navigate through the website and so that they can go onto any page from the current page they are looking at.

- On the login / signup page, users can see a world map and they can click on any country on the map which will bring them to the official government website on the number of Covid-19 cases for the country they clicked on. This allows them to easily find out the Covid-19 situation in the country that they are interested to know about. Having all these information at a single place makes it more convenient for users, as they do not have to do a google search to learn more about the Covid-19 situation for the country they are interested to know about. If they scroll down, they will be able to see a preview of what we are selling in the shop. It only shows the items that are on discount to attract them to find out more about all the items we are selling in our shop. If they click on any button such as the "buy now" or the "check out more items", they will be prompted to log in before they can check out the whole shop.

- After users log in, the page that users are directed to looks very similar to the ones they see before they log in. However, when they press the "buy now" or "check out more items" at the shop preview section, they will be directed to the shop page where they can see all the items that we are selling in the shop.

- The shop page contains all the items that we are selling. The discounted items are put in the top row and the non-discounted items will be placed below the discounted ones. 

- The learn page contains videos that users can watch to learn about the Covid-19 virus and how to protect themselves and their loves ones from the virus. There will also be a quiz where they can attempt and the more questions they get correct, the more points they will get and the points can be used to get a discount in the shop. For example, 1 point is equal to 1 cent so if they have 50 points, they can get a 50-cent discount on any item in the shop. This discount applies to discounted items as well. This way, not only do they get to learn about the Covid-19 virus, they are also more likely to buy items from the shop as the points they earned from the quiz can be used to get a discount in the shop.

# Technologies Used
- HTML is used for define the structure of the website.
- CSS is used to style the website (i.e., add colours, padding, etc.)
- Javascript will be used for the API implementation and to add interactivity to the website.
- RestDB will be used to store user data when they login or sign up and also the points users earn from the quiz.

# Testing
Up to date, most of the features have not been implemented yet. The quiz page has not been implemented yet and the map which is supposed to be clicked on to display the number of Covid-19 cases for the area clicked on is only halfway done. The buttons on the navbar to direct users to the respective pages are working. However, other features such as the applying discount to items through usage points, API to store user data and points and form validation have yet to be implemented as of now.
