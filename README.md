# Project Idea
Our idea is to create a website where users can see the number of Covid-19 cases worldwide and in each country. Additionally, there is a shop page where users can buy items related to Covid-19 such as hand sanitiser, masks and hand soap. There will also be a daily check-in system where if users continuously check-in, they can gain points which can be used to get a discount in the shop. There will also be quizzes and a leaderboard where the better they do, the more points they can get to get a discount in the shop. The website also allows them to key in their vaccination status and lets them know if their vaccination status will be expiring soon.
