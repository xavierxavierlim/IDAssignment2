# Covid Website
The website that we have created is a Covid website that aims to educate users on the Covid-19 pandemic so that they know how to protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus. Additionally, there is also a shop where they can buy items such as hand sanitiser and masks to further protect themselves and their loved ones from the virus. If they are planning to travel, they can check the number of Covid-19 cases in the country that they are planning to travel to.

# Design Process
- As a user who plans to travel overseas or travels overseas frequently, I would like a website where I can conveniently check the number of Covid-19 cases for the country that I am travelling to so that I know how good or bad the Covid situation is in that country. This will allow me to better prepare myself to protect myself from the virus.

- As a user who wants to learn more about Covid-19 and how to protect myself from the virus, I would like a website where I can enjoy learning about Covid-19 instead of reading off huge chunks of information from websites or watching Youtube videos from the website as it can get quite dry and boring. 

- As a user who wants to buy items to protect myself and my loved ones from Covid-19 such as masks and hand sanitiser, I would like a website where I can buy authentic hygiene items which are tested and proven to protect myself and my loved ones from the virus.

# Features

- On the login / signup page, 





<!-- Our idea is to create a website where users can see the number of Covid-19 cases worldwide and in each country. Additionally, there is a shop page where users can buy items related to Covid-19 such as hand sanitiser, masks and hand soap. There will also be a daily check-in system where if users continuously check-in, they can gain points which can be used to get a discount in the shop. There will also be quizzes (to educate users on Covid-19) where the better they do, the more points they can get to get a discount in the shop. The API implementation will likely be at the login / signup page and also at the quiz page where the API will be used to keep track of users' scores. -->
